# Backend

# Send Room data to front end:

#  Players? Which players are in a given room
#  Doors? Which walls have doors.
#  Objects? Does the room contain an object, such as the "crown" (to win).

# NOTE: Will be using WebSockets, in order to establish frequent (rapid) 2-way communication between the front-end and the back-end.
